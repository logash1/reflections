What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository git greates a hidden .git file that stores metadata
for the repository. You need to do it so that git can keep track of different versions
of your project and so that you can create commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

The staging area is sort of a pre-commit. It allows you to set up what files you would like to
include in the commit before you "commit" to it.
