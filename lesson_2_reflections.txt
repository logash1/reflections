What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository git greates a hidden .git file that stores metadata
for the repository. You need to do it so that git can keep track of different versions
of your project and so that you can create commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

The staging area is sort of a pre-commit. It allows you to set up what files you would like to
include in the commit before you "commit" to it. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can add changes to the staging area seperately. If you change one thing in one file
and something else in another you add the first file to the staging area and only commit that
one, then add the other and commit it seperately.
